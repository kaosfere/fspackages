* Aircraft configuration from the [XCUB Performance+](https://www.bushleaguelegends.com/addons/msfs/msfs-mods#h.kwo974aijdl8) mod
* A panel file from the [combined G1000/XCub/G3X](https://www.bushleaguelegends.com/addons/msfs/msfs-mods#h.58vus24k27a1) mod

It is meant to be used alongside the Working Title G3X.
