# Bush League Legends XCub

This is a combination of two different mods from the [Bush League Legends](https://www.bushleaguelegends.com/addons/msfs/msfs-mods) website:

* Aircraft configuration from the [XCUB Performance+](https://www.bushleaguelegends.com/addons/msfs/msfs-mods#h.kwo974aijdl8) mod
* Lighting graciously borrowed from [Uwa's lighting mods](https://uwajimaya.github.io/FS2020/)
* A slightly tweaked panel file with gauges and other customizations

It is meant to be used alongside the Working Title G3X.

Everything in the Effects directory is from Uwa's mod for the XCub and used unchanged.
